## Strength Analysis and Design of Bicycle Frame

For this project, I conducted a strength and analysis test on a bike frame, furthmore, I also propose new design changes to possibly improve the performance and FS (Factor of Safety) of the bike. The bike used for reference is a stell allow CCM Mountain Bike. 

### Project Outline
1. Used Fininte Element Analysis in SolidWorks to model bike structure and calculate forces/stresses in each beam of the bike structure
2. Made design changes and performed FEA to see effects of changes
