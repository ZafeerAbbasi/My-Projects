## Strength Analysis and Design of Bicycle Frame

For this project, I conducted a strength and analysis test on a bike frame, furthmore, I also propose new design changes to possibly improve the performance and FS (Factor of Safety) of the bike.
The bike used for reference is a stell allow CCM Mountain Bike. 


In this report we are conducting a strength and analysis test on a bike frame. In the latter half of the report we also propose new design changes to possibly help improve the performance of the bike.
The bike used for reference is a steel alloy CCM mountain bike. For the first part of the analysis, Finite Element Analysis is used within SolidWorks to calculate the forces and 
stresses in each beam for the replica frame structure, as shown in the rest of our report. For the second part we changed the material of the bike to aluminum this made it lighter, but slightly less durable.
From this project we can see that even before applying any design changes, the steel frame is more than capable of supporting the weight of the rider even when the rider has jumped onto the bicycle to start.
However, by changing the material we can improve the speed and lower the weight at the cost of durability and strength.
This project has given us an overall better and deeper understanding of the subject of statics and strength of materials.
