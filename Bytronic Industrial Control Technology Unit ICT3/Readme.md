## Bytronic Industrial Control Technology Unit ICT3

The goals of this project are to develop an effective, reliable, fully automated controller
for the ICT setup to assemble widgets, develop an approach for the system to recover in the
event of a power outage and develop a graphical user interface to allow a real-time snapshot
indicating what sensors and actuators are activated/deactivated at all times, the number of
widgets processed during the operation, the efficiency of the system and a pause button to
allow the system to halt operation using LabVIEW. LabView is a graphical programming
environment used to develop and validate test systems.
