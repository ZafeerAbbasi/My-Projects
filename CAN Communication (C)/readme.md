# CAN Communication 


## Project Description
In this project, I developed C code from scratch to implement simple CAN Communication between 2 MCU's: NUCLEO-F446ZE and STM32F103C6T6 BluePill.

## Demo

## Features
- Implemented button debouncing techniques for reliable behavior from input buttons
- Implemented 50-52MHz clock speed using PLL and HSE for both MCU's
- Implemented status updates and error handling through UART connection
- Implemented CAN Message filtering using ID Mask Mode
- Implemented interrupts for most interactions

## Hardware
- NUCLEO-F446ZE
- STM32F103C6T6 BluePill
- Waveshare SN65HVD230 CAN Board x2
- DSD TECH SH-U09C5 USB to TTL UART Converter
- CANADUINOÂ® ST-Link V2 USB 
- Multi-color LED's x4
- Push buttons x4
- 10KOhm Resistor x4


## Frameworks 
- STM32Cube HAL API's
- PlatformIO

## How it works
1. There are buttons connected to GPIO Pins of the F446ZE, whenver one of these buttons are pressed, they toggle an interrupt which signals the MCU to call a callback function.
2. In the callback, the button that caused the interrupt is determined and then a CAN Data frame is created containing information about the corresponding button and is given a CAN ID.
3. The CAN Frame is then sent by the STM32 bxCAN Peripheral CAN RX and CAN TX pins to the SN65HVD230 Transceiver, which converts the single-ended signals to differential, CANH and CANL signals, and sends it via the CAN Bus to the F103C6.
4. After the CAN Frame is sent, a TxMailboxComplete interrupt is signaled and thus triggers a callback. The STM32 bxCAN has 3 Tx Mailboxes, and I have added a TxMailboxComplete interrupt for each mailbox. So if the Tx scheduler uses mailbox X then TxMailbox(X)Complete interrupt is toggled.
5. In the TxMailboxComplete callback, a status update is sent via UART, as seen in the demo, containing the status of the message (sent or unsent) and the mailbox used to send the message.
6. When the CAN Frame reaches the F103C6, it first goes through a simple CAN Mask Mode filter to see if the CAN ID of the frame matches what we are expecting. (A possible improvement is to add multiple nodes, and each node would only accept CAN Frames for a specific CAN ID. Thus each node would have one LED, and only the node whos filter accepts the pending CAN ID would continue).
7. The callback function saves which button number was pressed and then creates a CAN Data frame and sends the frame on the CAN Bus, using the Transceiver to convert the CAN RX/TX single-ended signals to differential signals via CAN to the F103C6.
8. When the F103C6 received the CAN Data Frame, it toggles a receive interrupt, which signals the MCU to call a callback function.
9. This callback function interprets the CAN Data and then toggles a GPIO corresponding to the CAN data, and the GPIO is connected to an LED.
