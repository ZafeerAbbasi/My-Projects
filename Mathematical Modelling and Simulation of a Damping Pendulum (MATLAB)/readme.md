## Mathematical Modelling and Simulation of a Damping Pendulum

### Project Description

For this project, the objective was to model the behavior of a swinging pendulum by applying equilibrium of forces on a free-body using both analytical 
and numerical methods. For this purpose MATLAB was used to simulate the varying position and velocity of the pendulum with respect to time. For our 
analytical approach an oscillatory solution and derivation of that solution was used to evaluate the position and velocity respectively in a 
given period of time, these were then compared with the solutions obtained by solving the second order ODE numerically using the 
Runge-Kutta algorithm. Friction was accounted for by choosing random values for friction coefficient within the range provided to us.
