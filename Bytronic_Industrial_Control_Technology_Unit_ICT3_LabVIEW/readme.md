## Bytronic Industrial Control Technology Unit ICT3

## Project Description
Developed an effective, reliable, fully automated controller
for the ICT setup to assemble widgets, develop an approach for the system to recover in the
event of a power outage and develop a graphical user interface to allow a real-time snapshot
indicating what sensors and actuators are activated/deactivated at all times, the number of
widgets processed during the operation, the efficiency of the system and a pause button to
allow the system to halt operation using LabVIEW. LabView is a graphical programming
environment used to develop and validate test systems.

### The followings are the criteria for the project:
1. Development of an efficient, robust, fully automated controller for the ICT setup to 
assemble widgets. 
2. Development of a graphical user interface to allow the following: 
    1. A real-time snapshot indicating what sensors and actuators are activate/deactivated at all times.
    2. The number of widgets processed during the operation. 
    3. The efficiency of the system, which is the ratio between the numbers of widgets 
3. A means of system recovery in the case of a power loss. 
4. No more than 5 plastic pegs should be in the hopper, during the operation.
5. Clear and practical documentation including Introduction, System overview, Algorithms and 
Flowcharts, and Summary and conclusion.
