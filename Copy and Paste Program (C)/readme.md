## Copy and Paste Program


## Project Description
In this project, I wrote C code to essentially open a file in binary and then copy the binary content to another file, essentially performing a copy and paste.

# How to use
1. Download the my_cp.exe file and save it any directory, lets call that directory dir for now
2. Open terminal in the dir directory
3. Enter the command: ./my_cp.exe filepath_to_file_you_want_to_copy filepath_to_file_you_want_to_paste

# Demo
Here's a short demo explaining how it works
